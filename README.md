# Sample PHP Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth Access Token Generator

This is a sample PHP code that generates an Access Token using account credentials from Zoom [Server-to-Server OAuth App Type](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/server-to-server-oauth-app/#use-account-credentials-to-get-an-access-token) to make API calls to Zoom endpoitns. This helps PHP developers who are creating API Automation or Zoom Meeting SDK integration to establish the access token approach in order to use [Zoom APIs](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/using-zoom-apis).
